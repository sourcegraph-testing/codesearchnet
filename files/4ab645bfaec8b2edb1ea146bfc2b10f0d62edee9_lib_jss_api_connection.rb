  # Instances of this class represent a REST connection to a JSS API.
  #
  # For most cases, a single connection to a single JSS is all you need, and
  # this is ruby-jss's default behavior.
  #
  # If needed, multiple connections can be made and used sequentially or
  # simultaneously.
  #
  # == Using the default connection
  #
  # When ruby-jss is loaded, a not-yet-connected default instance of
  # JSS::APIConnection is created and stored in the constant JSS::API.
  # This connection is used as the initial 'active connection' (see below)
  # so all methods that make API calls will use it by default. For most uses,
  # where you're only going to be working with one connection to one JSS, the
  # default connection is all you need.
  #
  # Before using it you must call its {#connect} method, passing in appropriate
  # connection details and credentials.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #    require 'ruby-jss'
  #    JSS.api.connect server: 'server.address.edu', user: 'jss-api-user', pw: :prompt
  #    # (see {JSS::APIConnection#connect} for all the connection options)
  #
  #    a_phone = JSS::MobileDevice.fetch id: 8743
  #
  #    # the mobile device was fetched through the default connection
  #
  # == Using Multiple Simultaneous Connections
  #
  # Sometimes you need to connect simultaneously to more than one JSS.
  # or to the same JSS with different credentials. ruby-jss allows you to
  # create as many connections as needed, and gives you three ways to use them:
  #
  # 1. Making a connection 'active', after which API calls go thru it
  #    automatically
  #
  #    Example:
  #
  #        a_computer = JSS::Computer.fetch id: 1234
  #
  #        # the JSS::Computer with id 1234 is fetched from the active connection
  #        # and stored in the variable 'a_computer'
  #
  #    NOTE: When ruby-jss is first loaded, the default connection (see above)
  #    is the active connection.
  #
  # 2. Passing an APIConnection instance to methods that use the API
  #
  #    Example:
  #
  #         a_computer = JSS::Computer.fetch id: 1234, api: production_api
  #
  #         # the JSS::Computer with id 1234 is fetched from the connection
  #         # stored in the variable 'production_api'. The computer is
  #         # then stored in the variable 'a_computer'
  #
  # 3. Using the APIConnection instance itself to make API calls.
  #
  #    Example:
  #
  #         a_computer = production_api.fetch :Computer, id: 1234
  #
  #         # the JSS::Computer with id 1234 is fetched from the connection
  #         # stored in the variable 'production_api'. The computer is
  #         # then stored in the variable 'a_computer'
  #
  # See below for more details about the ways to use multiple connections.
  #
  # NOTE:
  # Objects retrieved or created through an APIConnection store an internal
  # reference to that APIConnection and use that when they make other API
  # calls, thus ensuring data consistency when using multiple connections.
  #
  # Similiarly, the data caches used by APIObject list methods (e.g.
  # JSS::Computer.all, .all_names, and so on) are stored in the APIConnection
  # instance through which they were read, so they won't be incorrect when
  # you use multiple connections.
  #
  # == Making new APIConnection instances
  #
  # New connections can be created using the standard ruby 'new' method.
  #
  # If you provide connection details when calling 'new', they will be passed
  # to the {#connect} method immediately. Otherwise you can call {#connect} later.
  #
  #   production_api = JSS::APIConnection.new(
  #     name: 'prod',
  #     server: 'prodserver.address.org',
  #     user: 'produser',
  #     pw: :prompt
  #   )
  #
  #   # the new connection is now stored in the variable 'production_api'.
  #
  # == Using the 'Active' Connection
  #
  # While multiple connection instances can be created, only one at a time is
  # 'the active connection' and all APIObject-based access methods in ruby-jss
  # will use it automatically. When ruby-jss is loaded, the  default connection
  # (see above) is the active connection.
  #
  # To use the active connection, just call a method on an APIObject subclass
  # that uses the API.
  #
  # For example, the various list methods:
  #
  #   all_computer_sns = JSS::Computer.all_serial_numbers
  #
  #   # the list of all computer serial numbers is read from the active
  #   # connection and stored in all_computer_sns
  #
  # Fetching an object from the API:
  #
  #   victim_md = JSS::MobileDevice.fetch id: 832
  #
  #   # the variable 'victim_md' now contains a JSS::MobileDevice queried
  #   # through the active connection.
  #
  # The currently-active connection instance is available from the
  # `JSS.api` method.
  #
  # === Making a Connection Active
  #
  # Only one connection is 'active' at a time and the currently active one is
  # returned when you call `JSS.api` or its alias `JSS.active_connection`
  #
  # To activate another connection just pass it to the JSS.use_api method like so:
  #
  #   JSS.use_api production_api
  #   # the connection we stored in 'production_api' is now active
  #
  # To re-activate to the default connection, just call
  #   JSS.use_default_connection
  #
  # == Connection Names:
  #
  # As seen in the example above, you can provide a 'name:' parameter
  # (a String or a Symbol) when creating a new connection. The name can be
  # used later to identify connection objects.
  #
  # If you don't provide one, the name is ':disconnected' until you
  # connect, and then 'user@server:port' after connecting.
  #
  # The name of the default connection is always :default
  #
  # To see the name of the currently active connection, just use `JSS.api.name`
  #
  #   JSS.use_api production_api
  #   JSS.api.name  # => 'prod'
  #
  #   JSS.use_default_connection
  #   JSS.api.name  # => :default
  #
  # == Creating, Storing and Activating a connection in one step
  #
  # Both of the above steps (creating/storing a connection, and making it
  # active) can be performed in one step using the
  # `JSS.new_api_connection` method, which creates a new APIConnection, makes it
  # the active connection, and returns it.
  #
  #    production_api2 = JSS.new_api_connection(
  #      name: 'prod2',
  #      server: 'prodserver.address.org',
  #      user: 'produser',
  #      pw: :prompt
  #    )
  #
  #   JSS.api.name  # => 'prod2'
  #
  # == Passing an APIConnection object to API-related methods
  #
  # All methods that use the API can take an 'api:' parameter which
  # contains an APIConnection object. When provided, that APIconnection is
  # used rather than the active connection.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   prod2_computer_sns = JSS::Computer.all_serial_numbers, api: production_api2
  #
  #   # the list of all computer serial numbers is read from the connection in
  #   # the variable 'production_api2' and stored in 'prod2_computer_sns'
  #
  #   prod2_victim_md = JSS::MobileDevice.fetch id: 832, api: production_api2
  #
  #   # the variable 'prod2_victim_md' now contains a JSS::MobileDevice queried
  #   # through the connection 'production_api2'.
  #
  # == Using the APIConnection itself to make API calls.
  #
  # Rather than passing an APIConnection into another method, you can call
  # similar methods on the connection itself. For example, these two calls
  # have the same result as the two examples above:
  #
  #   prod2_computer_sns = production_api2.all :Computer, only: :serial_numbers
  #   prod2_victim_md = production_api2.fetch :MobileDevice, id: 832
  #
  # Here are the API calls you can make directly from an APIConnection object.
  # They behave practically identically to the same methods in the APIObject
  # subclasses, since they just call those methods, passing themselves in as the
  # APIConnection to use.
  #
  # - {#all}  The 'list' methods of the various APIObject classes. Use the 'only:'
  #   parameter to specify one of the sub-list-methods, like #all_ids or
  #   #all_laptops, e.g. `my_connection.all :computers, only: :id`
  # - {#map_all_ids} the equivalent of #map_all_ids_to in the APIObject classes
  # - {#valid_id} given a class and an identifier (like macaddress or udid)
  #   return a valid id or nil
  # - {#exist?} given a class and an identifier (like macaddress or udid) does
  #   the identifier exist for the class in the JSS
  # - {#match} list items in the JSS matching a query
  #   (if the object is {Matchable})
  # - {#fetch} retrieve an object from the JSS
  # - {#make} instantiate an object to be created in the JSS
  # - {#computer_checkin_settings} same as {Computer.checkin_settings}
  # - {#computer_inventory_collection_settings} same as {Computer.inventory_collection_settings}
  # - {#computer_application_usage} same as {Computer.application_usage}
  # - {#computer_management_data} same as {Computer.management_data}
  # - {#master_distribution_point} same as {DistributionPoint.master_distribution_point}
  # - {#my_distribution_point} same as {DistributionPoint.my_distribution_point}
  # - {#network_ranges} same as {NetworkSegment.network_ranges}
  # - {#network_segments_for_ip} same as {NetworkSegment.segments_for_ip}
  # - {#my_network_segments} same as {NetworkSegment.my_network_segments}
  #
  # == Low-level use of APIConnection instances.
  #
  # For most cases, using APIConnection instances as mentioned above
  # is all you'll need. However to access API resources that aren't yet
  # implemented in other parts of ruby-jss, you can use the methods
  # {#get_rsrc}, {#put_rsrc}, {#post_rsrc}, & {#delete_rsrc}
  # documented below.
  #
  # For even lower-level work, you can access the underlying RestClient::Resource
  # inside the APIConnection via the connection's {#cnx} attribute.
  #
  # APIConnection instances also have a {#server} attribute which contains an
  # instance of {JSS::Server} q.v., representing the JSS to which it's connected.
